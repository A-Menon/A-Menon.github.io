Hi there! I'm Menon, a junior at [Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) studying CS and Math.<br><br>
I currently work on...
* **Reinforcement Learning** in the [Computational Cognitive Science Lab](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/index.php) under the advisory of [Tom Griffiths](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/index.php) and [Dilip Arumugam](https://dilipa.github.io/) @ Princeton
* **LLM-Based Kernel Autogeneration** in the [Dao AI Lab](https://github.com/Dao-AILab) under the advisory of [Tri Dao](https://tridao.me/) @ [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/)/Princeton and Han Guo @ [MIT](https://www.csail.mit.edu/)
* **Human-AI Complementarity** through [SPAR](https://sparai.org/) under the advisory of [Rishub Jain](https://rishubjain.github.io/) @ [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/)
